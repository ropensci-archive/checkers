[![Project Status: WIP - Initial development is in progress, but there
has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the
public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip)

**checkers** is a framework for reviewing analysis projects. This
package provides both automatied checks for best practises as well as a
descriptive guide for best practices.

# Analysis Review Criteria

Our full, in-development analysis review guide is available [here as a
google
doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OYcWJUk-MiM2C1TIHB1Rn6rXoF5fHwRX-7_C12Blx8g/edit#).
We categorize checks according to tiers of ‘best practise’ and potential
degree of automation:

Example check ‘best practices’ in terms of their importance (y-axis) and
the degree they can be automated (x-axis). ![](figs/compendium.png)

# Automated checks

The **checkers** package runs automated tests, using extensions on the
[**goodpractice**](https://github.com/MangoTheCat/goodpractice/)
package.

#### Installation:

``` r
devtools::install_github('ropenscilabs/checkers')
```

#### Usage

Run `gp_check()` on your analysis directory for a report on common best
practices for analysis directories.

``` r
library(checkers)
gp_check(path=system.file("scripts", package="checkers"),
         checks=c("comments", "version_control"))
```

    #> Preparing: scripts

    #> Preparing: version_control

    #> ── GP scripts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    #> 
    #> It is good practice to
    #> 
    #>   ✖ Place your project under version control. You are using
    #>     neither git nor svn. See http://happygitwithr.com/ for more
    #>     info
    #> ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Helper functions allow one to create custom checks for common tasks. For
instance, `make_pref_pkg_check()` defines a test for preferred packages.
These helpers are used with **goodpractice**’s (in-development) API for
extensions:

``` r
xml_check <- make_pref_pkg_check(unfavored = "XML", favored = "xml2")
gp_check(path=system.file("scripts", package="checkers"),
         checks="xml",
         extra_preps = list(packages=prep_packages),
         extra_checks = list(xml=xml_check))
```

    #> Warning: partial match of 'checker' to 'checkers'

    #> Preparing: packages

    #> ── GP scripts ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    #> 
    #> It is good practice to
    #> 
    #>   ✖ Use preferred packages. xml2 is preferred to XML.
    #> ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

**checkers** has a growing list of default checks but may also be
configured for personal or group preferences. A YAML file may be
provided to set project-, user- or system-wide defaults for checks:

    goodpractice:
      ["lintr_assignment_linter",
      "lintr_line_length_linter",
      "lintr_trailing_semicolon_linter" ,
      "lintr_attach_detach_linter",
      "lintr_setwd_linter",
      "lintr_sapply_linter",
      "lintr_library_require_linter",
      "lintr_seq_linter"]
    make_pref_pkg_check:
      XML:
        favored: xml2
        unfavored: ["XML"]
      JSON:
        favored: jsonlite
        unfavored: rjson
    if_this_than_that:
      gam:
        if_this: gam
        needs_that: gam.check
    comment_threshold: 0.05

## Review checklist framework

### Automation Levels

  - **Fully automatable:** Can be checked automatically by checkers
    (CURRENTLY GREEN)
  - **Semi-automatable:** Needs a human to provide commands on specific
    checks; can be done using custom implementations of
    checkers/goodpractice (CURRENTLY BLUE)
  - **Human-powered:** Analyst uses guidelines to make sure analysis and
    report fit best practice for specific context (CURRENTLY RED)

### Tiers

  - **Must have** : These elements are required for reliable and
    trustworthy analyses.
  - **Nice to have** : These elements are recommended for best practice
    and reproducibility and should be strongly considered.
  - **Recommended** : These elements are ideal best practice.

## Automatable examples

### 1\. **Automatable & “Must have”**

  - **Research phase :** Data
  - **Name :** Commenting
  - **Description :** It is important to comment your code so that you
    can remember what you have written and created. It also allows you
    to share with other people.
  - **Example :** Check to see if you have commented each code chunk.
    What is the % of comments contained in your code?
  - **Automation:** Potential

### 2\. **Automatable & “Nice to have”**

  - **Research phase :** Package/Organisational  
  - **Name :** Version control  
  - **Description :** It is important to store versions of your code as
    you program so you can go back to old versions of your analysis.
    This is important to help you debug and also help with collabration
    with others using tools like git/github or other version control
    providers.  
  - **Example :** Check to see if you have a git file  
  - **Automation:** implemented in **checkers**

### 3\. **Automatable & “Recommended”**

  - **Research phase :** Visualisation/Reporting  
  - **Name :** Grammar/Spelling  
  - **Description :** It is important that you have correct spelling and
    grammar in code and reporting.  
  - **Example :** Check that you have installed gramR *new* packag  
  - **Automation:** In development, see
    (**gramr**)\[<https://github.com/ropenscilabs/gramr>\]
